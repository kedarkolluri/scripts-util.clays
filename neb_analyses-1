nothing fancy. just that the neighboring K+ ion is moving away to accommodate.
the curve is not so great, though. there is an abrupt drop after the peak

nothing fancy about this!
so why does it have such a low energy?
Initial and final energies are nearly same in energy

This seems like it is halting (energy profile is consistant). At the center, Al has substituted Si

Nothing fancy either. Except that there is an adjacent K+ion moving aside

15/33 1.672
Nothing fancy. No K+ neighbor either.
#Perhaps the common theme in all these is that they don't have substituted Al in their vicinity?

There seem to be two peaks almost at the center.
Images show a "halting" ion at the center
need to minimize these images and see the structure and depending on where they fall, need to do second-level NEB

The reverse barrier is 2.474. So this does not technically come in the same
